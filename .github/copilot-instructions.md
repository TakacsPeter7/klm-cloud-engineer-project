## Project Overview

This workspace contains a complete solution for the D&T SSC Cloud Engineer Assignment featuring:

### üèóÔ∏è **Application Components**
- **REST API**: FastAPI-based Note-Taking API with full CRUD operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Infrastructure** 
- **Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Compute**: Cloud Run for serverless container deployment
- **Database**: Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) with private networking
- **Security**: VPC, Secret Manager, IAM, Cloud Armor
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible deployments

### üöÄ **DevOps & CI/CD**
- **Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow
- **Quality Gates**: Linting, testing, security scanning
- **Container Registry**: Google Container Registry
- **Automated Deployment**: Terraform + Cloud Run deployment

### üìã **Key Features**
- Scalable serverless architecture (0-10 instances)
- Enterprise security best practices
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Cost-optimized cloud resource usage
- Production-ready CI/CD pipeline

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. **Launch**: `docker-compose up -d`
3. **Access**: http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation
4. **Test**: Use provided curl examples in README.md

## Architecture Highlights

- **Security**: Private VPC, encrypted secrets, minimal IAM permissions
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling Cloud Run with load balancing
- **Reliability**: Health checks, automated backups, error handling
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use serverless model
- **Maintainability**: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This solution demonstrates enterprise-grade cloud engineering practices suitable for production deployment.
